# Next steps

- Update first endpoints so they use the new pattern with result builder.
  This would allow us to remove the `if result_type.is_a? Class` in
  `ResultBuilder`.
- Implement file downloads.
- Implement file uploads.
- Add a small module for configuration. Needs to contain the OAuth bearer.
