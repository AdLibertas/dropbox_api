# Goals to publish v0.1

- Add a small module for configuration. Needs to contain the OAuth bearer.
- Write a tutorial showing how to set up authentication in a Rails app.
- Write the following endpoints:
  - `list_folder_get_latest_cursor`
  - `list_folder_longpoll`
  - `list_revisions`
- Then we can remove `files.rb`
- Document API coverage.

# Further on

- Supporting streams would be great.
